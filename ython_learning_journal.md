Python Learning Notes – Days 1 to 3
Just keeping track of what I've learned so far from Mosh's Python course (watched up to 1hr 47min). Hoping this helps me stay consistent and actually remember stuff.

📘 Day 1 – Getting Started
What is Python?
Python’s a popular and beginner-friendly programming language. Easy to read and super flexible. People use it for everything from websites to data analysis and even AI.

Setup Stuff:

Downloaded Python from the official site

Installed VS Code as my editor

Wrote my first ever Python program:

python
Copy code
print("Hello, World!")
Pretty basic but satisfying 😄

📗 Day 2 – Variables, Types & If Statements
Variables & Data Types:

Variables are like labeled boxes where we store data.

Common types:

int: whole numbers (e.g., 10)

float: decimals (e.g., 3.14)

str: text (e.g., "hello")

bool: True or False

Conditions – if/else stuff:
Learned how to make decisions in code:

python
Copy code
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")
elif age == 18:
    print("Just turned 18!")
else:
    print("Minor")
Comparison Operators:

== equal

!= not equal

> greater than

< less than

>= greater or equal

<= less or equal

Logical Operators:

and: both must be true

or: one must be true

not: flips true to false and vice versa

📙 Day 3 – Loops & Functions
Loops:
Loops let me repeat stuff.

While loop: keeps going while a condition is true

python
Copy code
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
For loop: used to go through a list or a range

python
Copy code
for item in range(5):
    print(item)
Functions:
Functions let you group reusable code into one place.

python
Copy code
def greet(name):
    print("Hello", name)

greet("Kidus")
Functions can also return stuff:

python
Copy code
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
Let’s see how far I get with this. Just trying to stay consistent.
Feel free to copy if you're also starting out ✌️
